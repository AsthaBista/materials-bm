# Tutorial Data: Create a Computational Mesh with QGIS and BASEmesh

This repository contains data for the tutorial on creating a computational mesh with the [ETH Zurich's BASEmesh](https://basement.ethz.ch/download/tools/basemesh.html) plugin for QGIS.

The here provided data involve:

* flows/SteadyVanillaInflow.txt (steady inflow data)
* rasters/inn-dem.tif (small and coarse section of a DEM)
* shapefiles/breaklines.zip/breaklines.[SHP] (line shapefile with model boundaries and breaklines)
* shapefiles/liquid-boundaries.zip/liquid-boundaries.[SHP] (line shapefile with model boundaries to assign inflow and outflow conditions)
* shapefiles/region-points.zip/region-points.[SHP] (point shapefile with region markers)

The tutorial instructions are provided at [https://hydro-informatics.github.io](https://hydro-informatics.github.io/pre-qgis.html).
